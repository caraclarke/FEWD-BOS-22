Relaxr Landing Page: 
==================

For today, we'll be making a simplified version of the site which uses only one column. Your job is to build out the CSS - using the information below - for the page!

---

* benefits background color: #f0efef
* yellow: #f9e42e
* dark blue: #033048
* light grey: #606161
* almost black: #121212

* Font: Open Sans (Google Font: https://www.google.com/fonts#UsePlace:use/Collection:Open+Sans)
* Weight: Light, Light Italic, Semibold, Extrabold

* "Relaxr" - Extra bold, 24px
* "Get piece of mind with a single tap" - Semibold, 24px
* "Get it Now" - Extra bold, 14px. 5px border radius (use vendor prefixes)
* "Benefits" - Semibold, 20px
* "The perfect personal assistant. Relaxr does your job for you so you can enjoy life as it is meant to be." - Light, 13px
* Schedule meetings for you
* Excel automation to complete your work for you
* Responds to emails on your behalf
* Does all your work for you with our revolutionary AI technology" - Light, 13px

* "“Relaxr changed my life. I’ve been able to travel the world, spend limited time working and my boss keeps thanking me for crushing work.”" - Light Italic, 18px
* "- Amanda, Intuit " - semibold, 18px

* "Sign Up Now!" - extra bold, 12px, 5px border radius

* Relaxr - extra bold, 24px
* "Copyright 2015. Relaxr." - 9px, semibold

* Also: 
  * Use CSS psuedo classes to change every even item under "Benefits" to bold.
  * Use CSS3 box-shadow to make the button "Get it now" pop. Be sure to also use all the vendor prefixes. 
  * Make sure to use the HTML5 elements (header, footer, article, nav, etc) where they make sense
